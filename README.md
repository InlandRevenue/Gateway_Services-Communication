# Communication

## [Document](./Service%20-%20Document/)
> The Document Service enables documents to be retrieved by external software platforms as well as be submitted by external software platforms. 

## [Notification](./Service%20-%20Notification/)
> Notifications are very lean. They are delivered to software rather than people. It is the responsibility of the software to prioritise, filter and decide when and how to respond to each notification using the data within it.
