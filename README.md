# Communication

Use this repository to access software development kits (SDKs) for communication services offered through Inland Revenue's gateway services.

## [Document service](./Service%20-%20Document/)
The Document Service enables documents to be retrieved by external software platforms as well as be submitted by external software platforms. 

## [Notifications service](./Service%20-%20Notifications/)
Notifications are very lean. They are delivered to software rather than people. It is the responsibility of the software to prioritise, filter and decide when and how to respond to each notification using the data within it.
